This script incorporates a variety of machine learning algorithms specifically designed for data mining in high-temperature alloy materials. To utilize this script effectively, it is essential to ensure that the pre-prepared data and the Python script are located within the same directory. This arrangement facilitates seamless access and processing of the data by the script. The detailed steps for executing the script are outlined below:
1. Grant Execution Permissions:
Before running the script, you need to grant it execution permissions. This can be done using the following command in the terminal:
chmod +x ML_script.py
This command modifies the file permissions to allow the script to be executed as a program.
2. Run the Script:
Once the permissions are set, you can execute the script using Python. The command to run the script is:
python ML_script.py
This command initiates the script, which will then perform the specified machine learning tasks on the data located in the same directory.
By following these steps, the script will process the data using the embedded machine learning algorithms, providing valuable insights and analysis for materials.
